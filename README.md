# 5cripts_in_progress

Welcome to `5cripts_in_progress`! This repository is a collection of various scripts and CSS styles that I've been working on. They are primarily for testing, tinkering, and experimentation purposes.

## Philosophy

I adhere to the Suckless philosophy in my coding practices, emphasizing simplicity, clarity, and frugality. My goal is to create software that is minimalistic and straightforward, both in code and user interface. I aim to avoid feature bloat and overly complex implementations, focusing instead on maintainability, understandability, and extensibility.

## Contents

- **Scripts**: A variety of scripts that serve different purposes, from automation to utility functions.
- **CSS Styles**: Different stylesheets that can be applied to web projects or used for experimentation.

## Usage

Feel free to clone the repository and tinker with the scripts and styles. They are meant to be a playground for experimentation.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:4ndr0666/5cripts_in_progress.git
